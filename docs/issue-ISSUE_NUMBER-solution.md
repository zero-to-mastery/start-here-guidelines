# Fix for issue #ISSUE_NUMBER — Improve New Contributor Instructions

## Problem
The repository's onboarding instructions for new contributors are helpful but
some steps are not clearly explained for beginners. Many first-time contributors
struggle with understanding how to fork, clone, and create a pull request.

## Solution
This documentation update:
- Adds a clearer explanation of the contribution workflow.
- Breaks the steps into simpler, numbered instructions.
- Explains forking, cloning, branching, committing, and creating a pull request.
- Helps beginners onboard smoothly.

## Updated Contribution Steps (Simplified)

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork:  
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/start-here-guidelines.git`
3. Create a new branch:  
   `git checkout -b your-branch-name`
4. Make your changes and save the files.
5. Stage your changes:  
   `git add .`
6. Commit with a clear message:  
   `git commit -m "docs: improve contributor instructions"`
7. Push to your fork:  
   `git push -u origin your-branch-name`
8. Open a Pull Request on GitHub.
9. Wait for review and merge approval.

## Why This Fix Helps
